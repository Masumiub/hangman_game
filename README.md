# hangman_game
C++ Hangman Console Game
Implementing a hangman game using array. The program will randomly select a word from the
array and show the length of the word as underscores. Next, the user will guess a letter of the
word. If the guess is correct, the corresponding underscore will be replaced by the letter. The
game will be over if the user guesses the correct word or he reaches the maximum guessing
limit (length of the word+2). If he fails to guess the word, print the correct word after maximum
limit is reached.
